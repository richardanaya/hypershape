### Hypertext for the metaverse

Inspired by [vrml](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML), [a-frame](https://aframe.io/), and [htmx](https://htmx.org/) â€” hypershape is a [hypertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext) for building an interactable server-generated [metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse).

See a [demo](https://richardanaya.github.io/hypershape/dist/)

The markup language shall be known as `MHTL` (metaverse hypertext language)

### What made Web 1.0 great

Two key elements of HTML unleashed the power of Web 1.0

- `<a>` - The anchor element created the world wide web, it allowed a network of hypermedia servers to be traversed by a hypermedia client
- `<form>` - The form element allowed apps to be created on the world wide web by being a control that could submit data to server backends.

HyperShape aims to capitalize on these two ideas as it's foundations to make a metaverse that is traversable and modifiable.

### Principles

- WebGPU support by default
- Support PBR only
- MHTL only
- Be future forward for augmented reality

- `mv-space`
- `mv-model`
- `mv-link`
